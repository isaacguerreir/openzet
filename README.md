# openzet
`openzet` is my personal repository of open zet cards. Each card have a summarized content related to some topic created so I can remember things on the future. Zet is shorter for [Zettlekasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) a information system for personal knowledge base.<br><br>
