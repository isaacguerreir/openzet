Tamara Munzner an expert in information visualization who works as a professor of computer science at the University of British Columbia1. Her book called ['Visualization Analysis and Design'](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~machiraju.1/teaching/CSE5544/ClassLectures/PDF-old/book.120803.pdf) is one of the main resources related to Data Visualization. I also find a [series of Talks](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~tmm/talks.html) that she gave that I will take a look.
