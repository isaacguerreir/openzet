# First card in Zet

It's strange when you pass years trying but not actually getting some knowledge or tool, and somehow one day you wake up understanding the core ideas and start to improvising and now you know a lot about the topic. Could be music, programming or cooking, it always feel super weird.

In part that's exactly what happened here, I simply wanted a bash script for my personal zet and voi la, now I know how to build those kind of things.

**Update**
For some time this space was a personal ground where I could say, develop and try out openly. But now I'm interested in share some of my thoughts and see what happens.Let me know if this is useful for you somehow by leaving a comment on my commit and send a message.
